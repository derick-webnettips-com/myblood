28  For the holy spirita and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you except these necessary things: 29  to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols,b from blood,c from what is strangled,d and from sexual immorality.e If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper. Good health to you!”
